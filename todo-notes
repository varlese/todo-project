CRUD for Todo Lists

- Create new lists
Done.
Use input form to add new list and capture list name.

- Request list title
Need to use Javascript to get list name.
Use POST to transfer post name to app.py.
In app.py, need to create a new funtion to take the list name and ID (how do I get the ID?) to submit to the database.

- Update database with new list
Once the list name and ID is submitted to the database, I need to have it automatically route to a new URL using that list ID in app.py. (ID comes from database, not from user input (Model?))
